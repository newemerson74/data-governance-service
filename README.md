Cloud-native platform prototype for secure data governance and policy orchestration
# Data Governance Service

A cloud-native, microservice-based prototype for enterprise-grade data governance. Built to demonstrate secure policy enforcement, scalable architecture, and AI-assisted anomaly detection across hybrid environments.

## üåê Overview

Modern enterprises face growing complexity in securing sensitive data across distributed estates. This project showcases how platform engineering and thoughtful product leadership can address challenges in:

- Data classification and access control
- Policy orchestration and audit compliance
- Scalability across multi-cloud platforms
- Developer experience and CI/CD automation

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: .NET Core (C#), TypeScript/Nest.js
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Cloud**: Azure or AWS (configurable)
- **Security**: JWT Auth, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Secure API Gateway
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry, DataDog (mock integration)
- **AI Classification**: Basic anomaly detection logic using sample data streams

## üß© Architecture

- `src/api`: Secure RESTful endpoints with RBAC enforcement
- `src/policy-engine`: Dynamic policy evaluation module
- `src/anomaly-detector`: Simulated ML-driven detection logic
- `infra/terraform`: Infrastructure-as-Code for cloud provisioning
- `docs/architecture.md`: Detailed diagrams and explanation of system interactions

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-governance-service.git
cd data-governance-service
docker-compose up --build
